# MemWord
Project for Computer Programming II - Repeatedly Memorize your Words!

## Getting Started

This program aims to aid people to memorize word. Simply make csv files by parsing from the source you want, import them, and get it started!

### Dealing with Dependency

This program requires sqlite-jdbc-3.23.1.jar (external sqlite library). Use the link below to grab this file
```
https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/downloads/sqlite-jdbc-3.23.1.jar
```
and place it inside the Referenced Libraries section in project directory.

Otherwise, just running an executable jar is a viable option: Install MemWord.jar and Run.

### Making CSV Files

This program requires users to make CSV files to get the word data. Use programs (ex. MS Excel) you prefer and export them as CSV, or parse the data and have them in CSV format in order to make your CSV file.

The format of each row in CSV file is as below:
```
Word,Meaning
```
and distinguish them by new-lines.

### Importing CSV Files

After opening this program, select Import button and select your CSV file. Then specify your dictionary name. This name will be used later when accessing your dictionary.

### Selecting Dictionary

Select your item and select Select button, or double-click your item.
